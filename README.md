This is a remake of a project that I had made made in Dev Bootcamp.  
Goal of the project is to be able to generate a stock tracker.  
Application is created with React.js. It ensures a smooth and fast rendering of stocks value.  
Result are received via Yahoo stock API call.  
Here is where to get the [Yahoo API](http://meumobi.github.io/stocks%20apis/2016/03/13/get-realtime-stock-quotes-yahoo-finance-api.html).  
###Install
